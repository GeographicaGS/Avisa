/**
 * Class: OpenLayers.Handler
 * Base class to construct a higher-level handler for event sequences.  All
 *     handlers have activate and deactivate methods.  In addition, they have
 *     methods named like browser events.  When a handler is activated, any
 *     additional methods named like a browser event is registered as a
 *     listener for the corresponding event.  When a handler is deactivated,
 *     those same methods are unregistered as event listeners.
 *
 * Handlers also typically have a callbacks object with keys named like
 *     the abstracted events or event sequences that they are in charge of
 *     handling.  The controls that wrap handlers define the methods that
 *     correspond to these abstract events - so instead of listening for
 *     individual browser events, they only listen for the abstract events
 *     defined by the handler.
 *     
 * Handlers are created by controls, which ultimately have the responsibility
 *     of making changes to the the state of the application.  Handlers
 *     themselves may make temporary changes, but in general are expected to
 *     return the application in the same state that they found it.
